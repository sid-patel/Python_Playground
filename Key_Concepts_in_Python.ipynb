    "## 6. Understanding \"Self\" in Python :\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, **self** is a conventionally used parameter name in instance methods, including the **__ init __** method, to refer to the instance of the class that is calling the method. It acts as a reference to the object itself and allows access to its attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition of self :\n",
    "* **self is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods that belong to the class instance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points about self:\n",
    "**1. Instance Access:** It allows access to the attributes and methods of the current instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mandatory First Parameter:** For instance methods, self must be the first parameter (though you can name it something else, it is highly discouraged to break this convention).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scope:** self is only relevant inside instance methods, where it refers to the specific object on which the method is being invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why is self Explicit?\n",
    "* Python uses self explicitly in method definitions to make it clear which attributes and methods belong to the instance. This explicitness avoids ambiguity and enhances code readability.\n",
    "* In summary, **self** serves as a bridge between the methods and attributes of an instance and the actual instance object calling the method. It's crucial for object-oriented programming in Python!"

    "* #### print(f\"\\n{self.name}'s Percentage: {percentage:.2f}%\")\n",
    "* ##### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **f\" at the Start:** The f\" indicates that this is an f-string, allowing expressions inside curly braces {} to be evaluated and inserted into the string dynamically.\n",
    "2. **\\n:** The \\n adds a new line before the string output. This ensures the text starts on a new line.\n",
    "3. **{self.name}:** Inside {}, the value of the self.name attribute (likely the student's name) is inserted dynamically. For example, if self.name = \"Alice\", this part of the string will be replaced with \"Alice\".\n",
    "4. **'s Percentage:** A static part of the string, this will appear exactly as it is, providing context for the dynamic parts.\n",
    "5. **{percentage:.2f}:** This embeds the value of the variable percentage into the string, formatting it to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "    * The .2f part is a format specifier:\n",
    "    * f stands for \"fixed-point notation.\"\n",
    "    * .2 means the number will be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",

    "* The **__ init __** method in Python is a special method, also known as a constructor, used to initialize an object’s attributes when a class is instantiated. It is automatically called when you create a new instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.2 Purpose of **__ init __** :\n",
    "* ##### The **__ init __** method is primarily used to:\n",
    "    1. Initialize Instance Attributes: Set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
    "    2. Run Setup Code: Perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks for the instance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 8.3 Key Points about the **__ init __** Method\n",
    "* #### Automatic Invocation:\n",
    "    * **__ init __** is automatically invoked when an object is created from a class.\n",
    "    * You don’t need to call it explicitly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* #### Optional Parameters:\n",
    "    * You can define parameters for the **__ init __** method to accept data when creating an object.\n",
    "    * These parameters allow flexibility in initializing objects with different values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* #### Instance-Specific Initialization:\n",
    "    * Each object can have its own unique state because the attributes are initialized specifically for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Not Mandatory:\n",
    "    * A class does not require an **__ init __** method if no initialization is needed.\n",
    "* #### Default Return Value:\n",
    "    * **__ init __** does not return anything; it always implicitly returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Self Reference:\n",
    "    * self refers to the specific instance being initialized, allowing you to set instance attributes.\n",

    "#### 2.Understanding the Type of the Function percentage :\n",
    "* In Python, functions themselves have a data type, just like variables do. The data type of a function is <class 'function'>.\n",
    "* The function def percentage in our MyStudent class is an instance method. Methods in Python are objects of type function. When we call the method using the class instance (e.g., studentinput.percentage()), it becomes a bound method, meaning it is bound to the specific instance (studentinput).\n",
    "    * Print(type( **MyStudent.percentage** )) : This refers to the unbound method directly from the class and has the type <class 'function'>.\n",
    "    * print(type( **studentinput.percentage** )): This refers to the bound method attached to the instance (studentinput) and has the type <class 'method'>.\n",
    "    ##### Key Points:\n",
    "    ##### 1.Unbound Method (<class 'function'>):\n",
    "    * When you access the function directly from the class, it is treated as a plain function.\n",
    "    ##### 2. Bound Method (<class 'method'>):\n",
    "    * When the function is accessed via an instance, Python automatically binds it to that instance, turning it into a bound method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##### Summary:\n",
    "* The data type of the percentage function is **<class 'function'> when accessed from the class.**\n",
    "* The data type of percentage becomes **<class 'method'> when accessed from an instance.**\n",
    "* This distinction is essential for Python's object-oriented behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Instances are Objects of class they are created from:\n",
    "* An instance of a class is an object of the class it was created from, and its data type is <class 'YourClassName'>. \n",
    "* **Every present instance of a class is also an object**, in our case instance **s1 is an object and its data type is <class '__main__.MyStudent'>.** However, if we access a method (function within the class) through the instance, it is a bound method, and its data type is <class 'method'>.\n",
    "* for example : **studentinput.percentage()** its instance accessed using percentage method so **its type is <class 'method'>**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Classes Are Objects\n",
    "* **Classes themselves are objects of type <class 'type'>.** \n",
    "* This means:\n",
    "    * You can dynamically create classes using type().\n",
    "    * A class is an instance of the type metaclass, which defines how classes behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary :\n",
    "##### Everything in Python is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.Even primitives like integers, strings, and floats are objects.\n",
    "* Every object has a data type.\n",
    "* The data type of an object is determined by its class.\n",
    "##### 2.Functions are objects.\n",
    "* Functions are instances of <class 'function'>.\n",
    "##### 3.Classes are also objects.\n",
    "* Classes are instances of <class 'type'>.\n",
    "##### 4.Every instance of a class is an object.\n",
    "* Its data type is <class 'CreatedClassName'>. (In our case s1 instance belongs to class we created which is MyClass)\n",
    "##### 5.Methods are objects too.\n",
    "* When a method is accessed through an instance, it becomes a bound method, and its data type is <class 'method'>."
